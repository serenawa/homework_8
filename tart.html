		<p class="ingDescription">
			<b>Tart Shell</b> <br>
			1/2 cup Confectioners’ Sugar <br>
			1 1/2 cup All Purpose Flour<br>
			1 1/2 stick Unsalted Butter (room temp) <br><br>

			<b>Vanilla Custard</b><br>
			1 cup Heavy Cream<br>
			1 cup Milk (any kind)<br>
			4 Egg Yolks<br>
			1 1/2 tbsp Cornstarch<br>
			Dash of Vanilla Extract<br>
			1/4 cup Granulated Sugar <br><br>

			<b>Fruit Topping Suggestion</b><br>
			Strawberry<br>
			Blueberry<br>
			Kiwi<br>
			Blackberry<br>
			Raspberry 
		</p>

		<p class="tipDescription">
			1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Room temperature butter is necessary for the tart shell, cold butter is too difficult to mix. <br><br>

			2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don’t have time to get butter to room temp, melted butter is okay but will make the tart base greasy out of the oven. If this happens, dry tart shells on a paper towel to lessen grease. <br><br>

			3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t leave egg yolks at room temp too long, they will turn clumpy and curdle the custard. <br><br>

			4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep stirring the custard! To ensure an even cook, it’s essential to keep stirring and be patient.<br> </p>
